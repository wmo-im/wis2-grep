# Architecture diagrams

The architecture diagrams in this directory are designed using the [C4 model](https://c4model.com) for visualising software architecture.

The diagrams are saved as an editable `.png` file, for easy default viewing on GitHub, showing the last active diagram when saved. Any PNG
viewer will also render the diagram in the same way.

The diagrams can be updated using [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) in the following manner:

- open files on this GitHub repository directly in diagrams.net
- clone this repository, edit/save using the diagrams.net desktop application ([download](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases)), and commit/push files to GitHub
